# ComfyUI Segment Anything

This project is a ComfyUI version of
`https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-segment-anything`. At present, only the most core functionalities have been implemented. I would like to express my gratitude to [continue-revolution](https://github.com/continue-revolution) for their preceding work on which this is based.

![example](./docs/images/example.jpg)

I have ensured consistency with `sd-webui-segment-anything` in terms of output when given the same input.

## Requirements

Please ensure that you have installed Python dependencies using the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Models

The models will be automatically downloaded when used. You can also manually download them according to the table below. If the automatic download is slow, you can set the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables to use a proxy.

### bert-base-uncased

You can download the model from https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased/tree/main into the `models/bert-base-uncased` folder located in the root directory of ComfyUI, like this:

```
ComfyUI
    models
        bert-base-uncased
            config.json
            model.safetensors
            tokenizer_config.json
            tokenizer.json
            vocab.txt
```

You can also skip this step. During the inference process, `bert-base-uncased` will be automatically downloaded through the `transformers` library, and its directory is typically `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--bert-base-uncased`.

### GroundingDino

Please directly download the models and configuration files to the `models/grounding-dino` directory under the ComfyUI root directory, without modifying the file names.
